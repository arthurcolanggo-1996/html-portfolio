<h3>
    Hidden Figures
</h3>
<p>
    Hidden Figures is a book and film about the lives of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, three African-American women who worked as mathematicians at NASA during the Space Race. The women faced discrimination and segregation, but they persevered and made significant contributions to the agency's success. Katherine Johnson calculated the trajectory for Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 mission, the first American spaceflight; Dorothy Vaughan became the head of the West Computing Group, the first African-American woman to lead a computing unit at NASA; and Mary Jackson became an engineer, breaking the color barrier at NASA. Hidden Figures is a story of determination, perseverance, and the power of the human spirit.
